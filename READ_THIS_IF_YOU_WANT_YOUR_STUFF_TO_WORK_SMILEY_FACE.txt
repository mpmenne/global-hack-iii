So we're using Maven and spring boot.  They're both really awesome, but they have to be installed.

Make sure that you can run the mvn command on the command line (That means maven is installed).  Here are some instructions:

Here's a video on how Maven works:

Then make sure that you have this custom jar installed locally.  Run this command.  (You may have to change the slashes for Windows).
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install-file  -Dfile=lib/signalr-client-sdk-1.0.jar -DgroupId=microsoft.aspnet.signalr.client -DartifactId=signalr-client -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar

Here are the instructions for installing spring boot:

(The files that you need to install are in the included in this repository)

Run the following command to try out Spring boot (it launches a webserver with a simple Hello World controller)
spring run src/com/globalhack/TryOutSpringBootController.java
